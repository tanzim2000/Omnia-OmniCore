# Backlog

What is left to do, and what was deliberately put off. Last cleaned up
after v1.19.7. Anything already built has been removed from here; the
CHANGELOG is the record of what shipped.

If you are picking this back up after a break, this file plus
`docs/Architecture.md` should be enough to re-orient.

## Now: making the Essentials modules work properly

One module at a time, each with a user-friendly description, a "what it
needs from you" paragraph, and the right `minOmniCore` in the Registry.

1. **World Clock**: done (single, dual and multi clock).
2. **Weather**: label follows the location; a Source setting (Open-Meteo,
   Environment Canada, MET Norway, OpenWeatherMap, Google Weather); API key
   fields only for the sources that need one; attribution lines where a
   source requires them. Built against saved sample responses, because the
   development sandbox cannot reach these services. MET Norway needs a
   descriptive User-Agent, so check whether `omni.fetch` can send one.
3. **Prayer Times**: a list that can include forbidden times behind one
   switch, with the times following the school of thought chosen for the
   prayers; notifications at each prayer and forbidden time, priority
   setting the duration; a body with start, end and what comes next. The
   way forbidden times become clock times is still undecided (sun angles,
   mosque minutes, or adjustable minutes). Registry entry needs
   `background` and `notifies`.
4. **Calendar**: a complete rework, last.
5. **Docker Status**: very few options; give it more.
6. **Bing Wallpaper**: shows "Not reachable" in the development sandbox and
   it was never explained. Also needs its Registry ref published.

## Next: OmniCore

- **Marketplace never shows "Update".** `listAvailable()` already works out
  `updateAvailable` and `updateCompatible` for every entry, but the page
  only ever draws Install or a green Installed. Installed Resources does
  show it ("Update waiting: needs OmniCore 1.19.7"), so the two pages
  disagree. Show the update on the detail page and the listing, and say
  when OmniCore itself must be updated first.
- **A manual Update button.** Today updates only happen in the background
  after a check. Nothing lets a person press Update on one module.
- **No uninstall in the UI.** Removing a module or theme still means
  deleting its folder.
- **Test CI.** `npm test` has 20 test files, but nothing runs them on a
  push. The workflows only publish the image and the docs site.
- **Tag workflow concurrency.** Two `v*` tags pushed together can run the
  image publish at once. Push tags one at a time, or add `concurrency`.
- **Updates are only noticed for tagged releases.** An untagged version
  bump is invisible to the updater. Always tag.

## v2.0: settings rework

A heavy rework of the settings pages.

- A dedicated Marketplace segment on the settings home.
- A clear way from there to Resource Management (Installed Resources).
- Probably the moment to give the Marketplace a real visual pass too.

## Deferred, with why

**Sandboxing modules.** Modules are reviewed, then trusted like any
dependency: full Node access. The `omni` API split exists so a restricted
module can later get a smaller `omni` object. Not started.

**A native installer** (a Windows `.exe`, a signed Mac `.app`). Docker
Compose still needs one command in a terminal. Needs code signing,
per-OS packaging and a tray icon. A separate project.

**Container auto start and shutdown, and Docker Hub login.** Parked.

**Sideloading** from a local folder or URL. Never designed.

**`system-patch`**, a third resource kind that changes OmniCore's own
behaviour (a voice assistant character, say). No schema, no design.

**Richer author profiles.** The author page is an exact-match filter on
`author`. No bio, avatar or verified identity.

**Screenshots.** The mechanism works end to end, but every module's
`screenshots` array is empty. Screenshots for ntfy were deferred.

**Registry collisions.** If two sources list the same `id`, the built-in
registry wins. Reasoned about, never tested.

**Calendar widget types and recurring events (RRULE).** Part of the
Calendar rework.

**Windows 8 theme.** Needs a pass, and does not draw `time` blocks as
clocks yet (it falls back to plain text).

**More font subsets, and the Adamina `firstWoff2Url`.** Parked.

**`trust proxy`.** Parked until OmniCore is documented behind a reverse
proxy.

## Known rough edges

- No password reset: delete `data/admin.json` to start over.
- Plain HTTP only; use a VPN or reverse proxy off a trusted network.
- A face's tiles do not all remember their size between reloads; it is up
  to the theme.
- **OmniView** (the display client) and **OmniSync** are named but not
  built.
